# Data Project

The purpose of this project is to recognize and classify human emotions by examining the speech of different people. This project aims to make a discrete classification of the emotions into six classes: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fear, and disgust.
Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) dataset is used to classify emotions.
Python was used as the programming language to implement the algorithms during the project. Additionally, Librosa, being a Python library, was utilized to analyze the speeches by helping to examine the features of audio with its tools (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Mel Spectrogram, and Chroma).
Two different techniques being kNN and SVM are utilized to classify emotions.
